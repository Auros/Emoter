# Emoter (0.1.0)
Send emotes to your friends in multiplayer!

## Features
* Send emotes in multiplayer lobbies to people who also have the mod
* Change the duration the emote lasts for and the distance it travels
* Use an expanding list of public emotes
* Supporters can upload custom emotes for personal usage

## Suggest Emotes, Features, and Report Bugs!
Head over to the GITHUB ISSUES's tab to request emotes, features, and most important, REPORT BUGS!

Public Emote Rules:
* Aspect Ratio must be (1:1)
* Cannot already be uploaded
* Cannot be an inside joke
* Must be SFW

## Custom Emotes
This is a feature **CURRENTLY** available to supporters.

You will get a custom category in game and you can upload emotes online for them to appear there. You and only you will be able to use those emotes, and everyone will be able to see those emotes.

Supporters = Anyone who has EVER supported me financially through Ko-Fi, Patreon, and or GitHub Sponsors (doesn't have to be current)

(I eventually want to expand custom emotes to everyone, but I don't have time to build up the infrastructure to make sure it's safe right now.)
